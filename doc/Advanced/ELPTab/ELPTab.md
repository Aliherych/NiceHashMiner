# How to use the parameter view tab
This tab allows advanced users to set extra launch parameters per-miner/per-algorithm/per-device in a corresponding hierarchy.
### Important things to know:
- Configs for this are saved in the /configs/ directory in the NHM installation folder, the files are named like MINER_NAME-UUID, for example "NBMiner-f683f550-94eb-11ea-a64d-17be303ea466"
- If you mess something up, you can just delete the above mentioned files and nhm will generate new ones on restart.
