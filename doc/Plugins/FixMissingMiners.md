# How to fix missing miner downloads

The most common factors that result in missing miner files are:
1. Anti-Virus (**AV**) removing files
2. Failed autodownload: 
    * AV preventing download
    * ISP/geo blocking links

### Anti-Virus removing downloaded miner files

To fix this issue, you have to add your NHM installation path as an exception in your AV.<br>
For example if you have Windows Defender, add exception inside Virus & threat protection settings.
